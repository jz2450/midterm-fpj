# fpj (First Person Josh)
## "v2, babes, v2"

This web app allows you (a ghosty) to control another person (a hosty) through a live web interface. You see what Josh is seeing, you tell Josh what to do.

These files must be run in conjuction with a Node server running Socket.io, SimplePeer, and Express.

We are creating a version 2 for exhibition at the 2023 Maker Faire at Coney Island. This new version will aim to have all new webpage designs, controller support, side quests, and support for a horizontally mounted phone, as well as other changes to make the experience smoother for Hosty and Ghosty.
